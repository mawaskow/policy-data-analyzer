## Reading PDF files

The `src/data/reading_pdfs.py` script takes as input `data/raw/onedrive_docs.zip` and outputs `data/interim/pdf_files.json`
To execute the script you need to have the data folder structure described in the Project Organization section with the `onedrive_docs.zip` under `data/raw`. Then, after activating the python environment, run `make pdf_files` from the root directory.
