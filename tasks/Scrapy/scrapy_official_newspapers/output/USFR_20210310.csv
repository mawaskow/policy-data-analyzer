Based on a thorough review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we find that the Washington/Oregon/California population of the murrelet is a valid distinct population segment (DPS) in accordance with the discreteness and significance criteria in our 1996 DPS policy. Furthermore, we find that this DPS continues to be subject to a broad range of threats, such as nesting habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and predation. Although some threats, such as gillnet bycatch and lack of regulatory mechanisms, have been reduced since the murrelet's 1992 listing, the primary threats to the species' persistence continue. Furthermore, the species faces newly identified threats, such as abandoned fishing gear, harmful algal blooms, and observed changes in the quality of the bird's marine food supply. Population surveys conducted from 2000 through 2008 from San Francisco Bay to the Canadian border document a population decline during this period. Given our current understanding of the species' population size and trajectory, and in light of the scope and magnitude of existing threats, we conclude that the species continues to meet the definition of a threatened species under the ESA. Therefore, we have determined that removing the murrelet from the List is not warranted.",Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 12-Month Finding on a Petition To Remove the Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2010-01-21/granules/2010-951/summary?api_key=

Hydrogen sulfide was added to the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals in a final rule published in the Federal Register on December 1, 1993. However, on August 22, 1994, EPA issued an Administrative Stay of the reporting requirements for hydrogen sulfide in order to evaluate issues brought to the Agency's attention after promulgation of the final rule concerning the human health effect basis for the listing and the Agency's use of exposure analysis in EPCRA section 313 listing decisions. Although the final rule listing hydrogen sulfide under section 313 of EPCRA remained in force, the stay deferred the reporting requirements for hydrogen sulfide while EPA completed this further evaluation. EPA has now completed its further evaluation, including a consideration of additional information that has become available since the stay was put in place regarding the human health and environmental effects of hydrogen sulfide. Based on this further evaluation, EPA believes that the Administrative Stay should be lifted.

Changes to the OMB metropolitan area definitions through December 2009 are incorporated. The principal city for three metropolitan areas changed, which resulted in a code change. In Alaska, there was a name change for a nonmetropolitan borough and two boroughs in Alaska were divided to make four new boroughs.\1\ Proposed FY 2011 FMRs are based on 2000 Census data updated using more current survey data.

Section 3515 of the NDAA, titled America's Short Sea Transportation Grants for the Development of Marine Highways, amended Section 55601 of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, titled Short Sea Transportation Program. Section 3515 of the NDAA directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to establish and implement a short sea transportation grant program to implement projects or components of a project designated under subsection (d) of Section 55601. Marine Highway Projects are new waterborne transportation services, or expansions of existing services operating between U.S. ports or between U.S. ports and ports in Canada in the Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway. Projects are proposed by a project sponsor and formally designated by the Secretary under the America's Marine Highway Program. Projects that reduce external cost and provide public benefit by transporting passengers and/or freight (container or wheeled) in support of all or a portion of a Marine Highway Corridor, Connector, or Crossing may receive support from DOT and are eligible to compete for Marine Highway grants under the program described in this notice. Marine Highway projects and their designation are described in detail in the final rule published on April 9, 2010, at 75 FR 18095. It is neither the purpose nor the intent of these grants to shift passengers or freight currently moving by water to another water service, but rather to expand the use of marine transportation where landside transportation is currently being utilized and when the water option represents the best overall option. Therefore a project that directly competes with another, existing Marine Highway service will not be considered for a grant award. In order to receive a grant under the program, applicants are required to: submit an application to the Secretary in such form and manner, at such time, and containing such information as the Secretary may require, and demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the project is financially viable, the funds received will be spent efficiently and effectively, and a market exists for the services of the proposed project as evidenced by contracts or written statements of intent from potential customers. Applicants are required to provide at least 20 percent of the project costs from non-Federal sources. In awarding grants under the program, the Secretary shall give preference to those projects or components that present the most financially viable transportation services and require the lowest percentage Federal share of the costs. A plan is financially viable upon demonstration to the Secretary of Transportation that the project will be sustainable in a specified and reasonable timeframe. The Maritime Administration's Fiscal Year 2010 appropriations, signed by the President of the United States on December 16, 2009, included $7,000,000 to ``designate and support specific projects that will create new or expanded services along designated Marine Highway Corridors.'' Funds for this purpose will be allocated through the Marine Highway Grant Program established in the NDAA and set forth in this notice. This notice announces the availability of funding for Marine Highway grants, and establishes selection criteria and application requirements. Marine Highway Grants will be awarded to applicants to implement projects or components of projects designated under America's Marine Highway Program as outlined in the final rule published on April 9, 2010. Eligible applicants must be sponsors of Marine Highway Projects formally designated by the Secretary. Sponsors of designated Marine Highway Projects are eligible to apply for a Marine Highway Grant as described in this notice.",America's Marine Highway Grant Notice of Funding Availability,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2010-08-12/granules/2010-20013/summary?api_key=

At the time of original type certification, a special condition was issued for each model helicopter because the applicable airworthiness regulations did not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for turbine-engine rotorcraft or for rotorcraft with a maximum gross weight over 20,000 pounds that were designed solely to perform external load-operations. At the request of Erickson Air-Crane, the current type certificate (TC) holder for these helicopter models, the following will resolve reported difficulty in applying the existing special conditions and eliminate any confusion that has occurred in Erickson's dealings with a foreign authority. Specifically, we are consolidating the separate special conditions for each model helicopter into one special condition to clarify and more specifically reference certain special condition requirements to the regulatory requirements, to add an inadvertently omitted fire protection requirement, to recognize that occupants may be permitted in the two observer seats and the rear-facing operator seat during other than external-load operations, and to clarify the requirements relating to operations within 5 minutes of a suitable landing area.

This is a project specific waiver and only applies to the use of the specified product for the ARRA project being proposed. Any other ARRA recipient that wishes to use the same product must apply for a separate waiver based on project specific circumstances. The Town evaluated eight different types of pressure filter media selecting GreensandPlus filter media. The ARRA funded project is for Well House upgrades that include filter media replacement, two filters in Well House <greek-i>1, two filters in Well House <greek-i>2 and two filters in Well House <greek-i>3 in the Smyrna system. If an alternate domestic filter media were to be installed in the six pressure filters, the Town's system would experience increased backwash requirements, reduced capacity and would need modifications/replacement of underdrain and filter piping. Based upon information submitted by the Town and its consulting engineer, EPA has concluded that there are no filter media manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonable quantity and of a satisfactory quality to meet the technical specifications and that a waiver of the Buy American provisions is justified. The Regional Administrator is making this determination based on the review and recommendations of the EPA Region III, Water Protection Division, Office of Infrastructure and Assistance. The Assistant Administrator of the Office of Administration and Resources Management has concurred on this decision to make an exception to the requirements of Section 1605(a) of ARRA. This action permits the purchase of GreensandPlus pressure filter media for the proposed project being implemented by the Town of Smyrna.","Notice of a Regional Project Waiver of Section 1605 (Buy American) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) to the Town of Smyrna, DE",https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2011-01-03/granules/2010-33111/summary?api_key=

The Commission now finds that, if necessary, spent fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safely and without significant environmental impacts for at least 60 years beyond the licensed life for operation (which may include the term of a revised or renewed license) of that reactor in a combination of storage in its spent fuel storage basin or at either onsite or offsite independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSIs).

The three meetings will be identical in terms of agenda and purpose; they are being held in the different locations to maximize stakeholder participation. The U.S.-Flag Great Lakes Fleet Revitalization Study will examine the current and potential future role of Great Lakes shipping in supporting the region's economy and as an important component of the greater U.S. Marine Highway system serving the Nation at large. It will also be used to assess the impact of new environmental regulations on the U.S.-Flag Great Lakes Fleet. Of particular interest is the likely impact of the EPA's final emission standards for new marine diesel ``Category 3'' engines that goes into effect in January 2012. This study calls for the identification and evaluation of options to recapitalize U.S. vessels and port infrastructure on the Great Lakes, using private and public sector investments, to generate the greatest net benefits for the region and the Nation. This Maritime Administration study will be a two-phase effort to estimate the costs and options for complying with the new environmental regulations. The first phase will be a data gathering effort. An inventory of current vessel and port assets will be developed. That inventory will be used to determine if the Maritime Administration can assist the U.S. Flag Great Lakes vessel operators in complying with the new regulations. During the second phase of the study, the Maritime Administration will examine a mix of private and public sector financing options that could be used for vessel or port alterations necessitated by the new environmental regulations. This analysis will be used in developing strategies for how the Maritime Administration might assist the U.S.- Flag Great Lakes Fleet and ports in making those changes. The Maritime Administration will use the study's findings to develop strategies to promote the U.S.-Flag Great Lakes Fleet and Ports. Stakeholder input is an essential part of the strategy- development process, so the study plan includes three stakeholder listening-sessions where the important issues raised by the study will be discussed. Topics of discussion include the new EPA environmental regulations such as the Control of Emissions from Category 3 Marine Engines and their impact on Great Lakes vessel operators, the state of the Great Lakes shipping markets, and issues facing vessel operators and port operators.",Stakeholder Meetings Regarding the U.S.-Flag Great Lakes Fleet Revitalization Study,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2010-12-29/granules/2010-32761/summary?api_key=

Identification of candidate species can assist environmental planning efforts by providing advance notice of potential listings, allowing landowners and resource managers to alleviate threats and thereby possibly remove the need to list species as endangered or threatened. Even if we subsequently list a candidate species, the early notice provided here could result in more options for species management and recovery by prompting candidate conservation measures to alleviate threats to the species. The CNOR summarizes the status and threats that we evaluated in order to determine that species qualify as candidates and to assign a listing priority number (LPN) to each species or to determine that species should be removed from candidate status. Additional material that we relied on is available in the Species Assessment and Listing Priority Assignment Forms (species assessment forms) for each candidate species. Overall, this CNOR recognizes three new candidates, changes the LPN for seven candidates, and removes three species from candidate status. Combined with other decisions for individual species that were published separately from this CNOR in the past year, the current number of species that are candidates for listing is 244.

Under section 244(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Secretary is authorized to grant TPS to eligible nationals of designated foreign states or parts of such states (or to eligible aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in such states) upon finding that such states are experiencing ongoing armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent nationals from returning safely. This designation allows eligible South Sudan nationals (and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in the region that is now South Sudan) who have continuously resided in the United States since October 7, 2004 to obtain TPS. In addition to demonstrating continuous residence in the United States since October 7, 2004, applicants for TPS under this designation must demonstrate that they have been continuously physically present in the United States since November 3, 2011, the effective date of the designation of South Sudan. The Secretary has established November 3, 2011, as the effective date so that the 18-month designation of South Sudan will coincide with the 18-month extension period of TPS for Sudan, which is also being announced today. Although November 3, 2011, is a future date, applicants may begin applying for TPS immediately. This designation is unique because on July 9, 2011, South Sudan became a new nation and independent from the Republic of Sudan, which has been designated for TPS since 1997. Some individuals who are TPS beneficiaries under the current designation of Sudan may now be nationals of South Sudan, calling into question their continued eligibility for TPS under the Sudan designation. These individuals may, however, now qualify for TPS under the South Sudan designation. This Notice sets forth regular procedures and special procedures necessary for nationals of South Sudan (or aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in the region that is now South Sudan) to register and to apply for TPS and Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Given the timeframes involved with processing TPS applications, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recognizes that individuals who have EADs under Sudan TPS that expire November 2, 2011 may not receive new EADs under South Sudan TPS until after their current EADs expire. Accordingly, the validity of EADs issued under the TPS designation of Sudan has been automatically extended for 6 months, through May 2, 2012. This automatic extension includes individuals who are now applying for TPS under the designation of South Sudan but were granted TPS and were issued an EAD under the Sudan designation. This Notice explains how TPS beneficiaries and their employers may determine which EADs are automatically extended and how the extension affects employment eligibility verification (Form I-9 and E-Verify) processes. This Notice also describes examples of acceptable evidence of South Sudanese nationality required for TPS registration under the South Sudan designation.",Designation of Republic of South Sudan for Temporary Protected Status,https://api.govinfo.gov/packages/FR-2011-10-13/granules/2011-26537/summary?api_key=

Sandbar sharks are still overfished, but no longer experiencing overfishing. Dusky sharks are still overfished and still experiencing overfishing (i.e., their stock status has not changed). Blacknose sharks were assessed as two separate stocks for the first time in the 2010/2011 assessment (Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico); therefore, NMFS is making separate stock status determinations for the two blacknose shark stocks. The Atlantic stock is overfished and experiencing overfishing, and the status of the Gulf of Mexico stock is unknown. Scalloped hammerhead sharks were previously determined to be overfished and experiencing overfishing by NMFS in April 2011. As such, NMFS announces its intent to prepare an EIS under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This EIS would assess the potential effects on the human environment of action proposed through rulemaking to rebuild and end overfishing of these stocks, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). Through the rulemaking process, NMFS would amend the 2006 Consolidated Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and examine management alternatives available to rebuild these shark stocks and end overfishing, as necessary.
