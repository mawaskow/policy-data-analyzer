Sentence splitting evaluation

----------------------------------
Some general evaluation criteria:

-> "/" means good sentence
-> "-/" means good sentence with a little bit of unnecessary additions
-> "~/" means that it's understandable why this was considered (or not) a sentence, but it shouldn't have been because of how it works in the domain... in theory this is not bad, not taking points away for this
-> "-" means not all the sentence was parsed/more than one sentences were parsed
-> For non-clear sentences, we guide ourselves by the new line character

CHILE

>>> Chile1.txt

-> Evaluation substring:from the beginning until "Párrafo II"

- NLTK
	- Total identified sentences: 77
	- Identifies bullet points well, except the first one, if it comes after a heading like "Titulo I" or "Parrafo I", then the heading + the bullet point get processed
	- Accurate sentences for evaluation substring: 15/16 (only half mistakes)

- Manual
	- Total identified sentces: 127
	- Gets rid of bullet points and letter/numbers (like a) or 1.) 
	- Also gets rid of words that appear a customizable stopwords list (such as "Decreto").
	- Accurate sentences for evaluation substring: 17/19  (only half mistakes)

- SpaCy
	- Total identified sentences: 94
	- Similar to NLTK, the first bullets (like a)) can be appended to the heading, unnecessarily
	- Accurate sentences for evaluation substring: 22/24 (only half mistakes)

>>> Chile2.txt

-> Evaluation substring:from the beginning until "Lote 4 (b) de 1.171,08 hectáreas."

- NLTK
	- Total identified sentences: 192
	- Many badly split sentences here --> this time one sentence got split into multiple ones because of things like "ord." and "Sra." and "Corp." and "U.T.M."


TODO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:
--> Find a way of evaluating the sentences in terms of the document


>>> General patterns to take in account for preprocessing:
- Get rid of law numbers (Ley No 12.345) - splitting by space, identifying element next to No. and replacing with "Numero" and a random number.
- We need to do something about the bullet points like "a)"... Maybe we add a new line to the back, so it gets considered as a new sentence? Or we deal with them after the initial sentence splitting 
- Get rid of patterns like ".-" which are only confusing
- Stopwords... are they useful? like "Articulo 7.-" or "Decreto:"... so far, they seem to not mess up with the sentence splitting system.
- Get rid of semicolons? or replace them by periods? or replace them by spaces, or replace them by commas?
