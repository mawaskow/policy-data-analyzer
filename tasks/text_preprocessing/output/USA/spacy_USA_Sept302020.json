    "Sentence_42": "with the term ``State  best management practices.''     ",
    "Sentence_43": "In addition, in this rule, we change the way in which the  provisions of the 4(d) rule for the trispot darter appear in 50 CFR  17.44 from what we proposed; here, we do not refer to the prohibitions  and provisions set forth in section 9(a)(1) of the Act.",
    "Sentence_44": "Instead, we  refer to the prohibitions set forth at 50 CFR 17.21, which apply to  endangered species.",

    "Sentence_46": "Background      ",
    "Sentence_47": "The trispot darter is a small-bodied, freshwater fish found in the  Coosa River System, above the fall line in the Ridge and Valley of  Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee.",
    "Sentence_48": "It is a migratory species that uses  distinct breeding and nonbreeding habitats.",
    "Sentence_49": "From approximately April to  October, the species inhabits its nonbreeding habitat, which consists  of small to medium river margins and lower reaches of tributaries with  slower velocities.",
    "Sentence_50": "After October, trispot darters move from the main  channels into tributaries, eventually reaching adjacent seepage areas  where they congregate and remain for the duration of spawning, until  approximately late April.",
    "Sentence_51": "Breeding sites are intermittent seepage areas  and ditches with little to no flow and shallow depths (12 inches (30  centimeters) or less).     ",
    "Sentence_52": "For a full summary of species information, please refer to the  October 4, 2017, proposed listing rule (82 FR 46183) and the species  status assessment (SSA) report for the trispot darter (Service 2018,  entire).",

    "Sentence_57": "Summary of Comments and Recommendations      ",
    "Sentence_58": "On December 28, 2018, we proposed a 4(d) rule for the trispot  darter (83 FR 67185).",
    "Sentence_59": "We accepted public comments on the proposed 4(d)  rule for 60 days, ending February 26, 2019.",
    "Sentence_60": "During the comment period,  we received 13 comments addressing the proposed 4(d) rule.",
    "Sentence_61": "Eight of the  comments supported the general protections of the proposed 4(d) rule,  and five explicitly expressed support for our conservation strategy of  sustainable forest management and best management practices.",
    "Sentence_62": "None of  the comments opposed the proposed 4(d) rule.",
    "Sentence_63": "All substantive  information provided during the comment period has either been  incorporated directly into this final rule or is addressed in our  responses below.  ",
    "Sentence_64": "State Comments      Comment",
    "Sentence_65": ": The Alabama Forestry Commission commented that limiting  silvicultural and forest management activities to May 1 through  December 31 is concerning and may be unnecessary with BMP compliance.     ",
    "Sentence_66": "Our Response: The 4(d) rule identifies actions that are prohibited  in order to protect the darter, as well as actions that are excluded  from those prohibitions, including certain forest management  activities.",
    "Sentence_67": "Because trispot darters spawn from January through April,  making this the most sensitive period of the species' lifecycle, the  exclusions for forest management activities in spawning habitat apply  only from May 1 through December 31.",
    "Sentence_68": "During the spawning period, the  exclusions do not apply in areas where spawning habitat is present;  however, in non-spawning habitat, the exclusions apply year-round.",
    "Sentence_69": "In  some cases, silvicultural and forest management activities may still be  undertaken in areas that are spawning habitat during the spawning  season, as long as there is consultation with the Service under section  7 of the Act or a conservation agreement under section 10 of the Act.  ",
    "Sentence_70": "Performing silvicultural and forest management activities in the range  of the trispot darter between May 1 and December 31, while applying  State best management practices, will not adversely affect, and may  provide conservation benefits for, the species.  ",
    "Sentence_71": "Public Comments      Comment",
    "Sentence_72": ": In regard to silviculture practices or forest management  activities, we received three public comments and one comment from the  Alabama Forestry Commission concerning our use of the term ``highest- standard best management practices.''",
    "Sentence_73": "Specifically, one public  commenter requested clarification of the term, and two other public  commenters requested amending the term to ``State best management  practices.''",
    "Sentence_74": "The State agency commented that Alabama's best management  practices for forestry clearly state that stream management zones,  stream crossings, and forest roads must always be sufficient in design  and filtering capacity to not impact water quality and passage of  aquatic species.",
    "Sentence_75": "Thus, complying with Alabama's best management  practices should ensure water quality and the reference for the need to  ``implement the highest-standard best management practices'' is not  needed.     ",
    "Sentence_76": "Our Response: Best management practices can change over time as new  scientific and commercial information becomes available.",
    "Sentence_77": "Therefore,  rather than specifying a particular set of best management practices,  we interpreted ``highest-standard best management practices'' to refer  to the most stringent ones available at the time of project  implementation.",
    "Sentence_78": "To clarify the terminology, we removed the term  ``highest-standard'' and now refer to these practices (the most  stringent ones currently available) as ``State best management  practices,'' which constitute the highest standard.  ",
    "Sentence_79": "Final Rule Issued Under Section 4(d) of the Act  Background      Section 4(d) of the Act contains two sentences.",
    "Sentence_80": "The first sentence  states that the ``Secretary shall issue such regulations as he deems  necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation'' of species  listed as threatened.",
    "Sentence_81": "The U.S. Supreme Court has noted that statutory  language like ``necessary and advisable'' demonstrates a large degree  of deference to the agency (see Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988)).  ",
    "Sentence_82": "Conservation is defined in the Act to mean ``the use of all methods and  procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or  threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant  to [the Act] are no longer necessary.''",
    "Sentence_83": "Additionally, the second  sentence of section 4(d) of the Act states that the Secretary ``may by  regulation prohibit with respect to any threatened species any act  prohibited under section 9(a)(1), in the case of fish or wildlife, or  9(a)(2), in the case of plants.''",
    "Sentence_84": "Thus, the combination of the two  sentences of section 4(d) of the Act provide the Secretary with wide  latitude of discretion to select and promulgate appropriate regulations  tailored to the specific conservation needs of the threatened species.  ",
    "Sentence_85": "The second sentence grants particularly broad discretion to the Service  when adopting the prohibitions under section 9.     ",
    "Sentence_86": "The courts have recognized the extent of the Secretary's discretion  under this standard to develop rules that are appropriate for the  conservation of a species.",
    "Sentence_87": "For example, courts have upheld rules  developed under section 4(d) as a valid exercise of agency authority  where they prohibited take of threatened wildlife, or include a limited  taking prohibition (see Alsea Valley Alliance v. Lautenbacher, 2007  U.S. Dist.",
    "Sentence_88": "Lexis 60203 (D. Or. 2007); Washington Environmental Council  v. National Marine Fisheries Service, 2002 U.S. Dist.",
    "Sentence_89": "Lexis 5432",
    "Sentence_90": "(W.D.  Wash. 2002)).",
    "Sentence_91": "Courts have also upheld 4(d) rules that do not address  all of the threats a species faces (see State of Louisiana v. Verity,  853 F.2d 322 (5th Cir. 1988)).",
    "Sentence_92": "As noted in the legislative history when  the Act was initially enacted, ``once an animal is on the threatened  list, the Secretary has an almost infinite number of options available  to him with regard to the permitted activities for those species.",
    "Sentence_93": "He  may, for example, permit taking, but not importation of such species,  or he may choose to forbid both taking and importation but allow the  transportation of such species''",
    "Sentence_94": "(H.R. Rep. No. 412, 93rd Cong.",
    "Sentence_95": ", 1st  Sess. 1973).     ",
    "Sentence_96": "Exercising its authority under section 4(d), the Service has  developed a final rule for the trispot darter that is designed to  address the species' specific threats and conservation needs.",
    "Sentence_97": "Although  the statute does not require the Service to make a ``necessary and  advisable'' finding with respect to the adoption of specific  prohibitions under section 9, we find that this final 4(d) rule as a  whole satisfies the requirement in section 4(d) of the Act to issue  regulations deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the  conservation of the trispot darter.",
    "Sentence_98": "As discussed in the final listing  rule (83 FR 67131; December 28, 2018), the Service has concluded that  the trispot darter is likely to become in danger of extinction within  the foreseeable future primarily due to threats that degrade instream  habitat and reduce water quality and water quantity, all which reduce  connectivity between populations.",
    "Sentence_99": "The provisions of this final 4(d)  rule promote conservation of the trispot darter by encouraging  management of stream systems and the landscapes they drain while also  meeting land use management considerations.",
    "Sentence_100": "The provisions of this  final 4(d) rule are one of many tools that the Service will use  [[Page 61616]]  ",
    "Sentence_101": "to promote the conservation of the trispot darter.  ",

    "Sentence_104": "This final 4(d)",
    "Sentence_105": "rule provides for the conservation of the trispot  darter by prohibiting the following activities, except as otherwise  authorized or permitted: Importing or exporting; take; possession and  other acts with unlawfully taken specimens; delivering, receiving,  transporting, or shipping in interstate or foreign commerce in the  course of commercial activity; and selling or offering for sale in  interstate or foreign commerce.",
    "Sentence_106": "We also include several standard  exclusions to these prohibitions, which are set forth under Regulation  Promulgation, below, as well as some species-specific exclusions.     ",
    "Sentence_107": "As discussed in the final listing rule (83 FR 67131)",
    "Sentence_108": "a range of  natural and anthropogenic factors that affect aquatic systems may  impact the status of the trispot darter.",
    "Sentence_109": "The largest threat to the  future viability of the species is habitat degradation from stressors  ",
    "Sentence_110": "that influence four habitat elements: water quality, water quantity,  instream habitat, and habitat connectivity.",
    "Sentence_111": "These stressors include  hydrologic alteration, sedimentation, loss of connectivity, loss of  riparian vegetation, contaminants entering the water system due to  agricultural activities (such as excessive poultry litter and livestock  entering streams), and urbanization within the watersheds inhabited by  the species.",
    "Sentence_112": "Regulating these activities would reduce their combined  negative effects, providing for the conservation of the trispot darter  by helping to preserve remaining populations.     ",
    "Sentence_113": "Conservation actions that benefit the trispot darter include  habitat restoration and protection.",
    "Sentence_114": "Additionally, conservation may be  achieved through augmentation of populations to increase their size  ",
    "Sentence_115": "(number of individuals), which increases resiliency to adverse events  such as storms and droughts, inadvertent runoff of pollutants and  sediment, and contaminant spills.",
    "Sentence_116": "This rule provides exceptions from  the Act's incidental take prohibitions, accommodating species  restoration efforts by State wildlife agencies, channel restoration  projects, and streambank stabilization projects.",
    "Sentence_117": "Further, this rule  enhances habitat protection, by providing exceptions to incidental take  provisions for silviculture and forest management that implement best  management practices; transportation projects that provide for fish  passage in waters occupied by the trispot darter; and projects carried  out under the Working Lands for Wildlife program of the Natural  Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
    "Sentence_118": "The  provisions in this rule for channel restoration and habitat protection  can occur only between May 1 and December 31, to avoid the trispot  darter's spawning period, when seasonal spawning areas are wetted.",
    "Sentence_119": "This  curtails the likelihood of incidental take occurring.",
    "Sentence_120": "Although the  exceptions for certain activities may result in some minimal level of  harm or temporary disturbance to the trispot darter, overall, these  activities benefit the species by contributing to conservation and  recovery.     ",
    "Sentence_121": "The provisions in this rule are necessary and advisable because the  species needs active conservation to improve the quality of its habitat  and, absent protections, the species is likely to become in danger of  extinction within the foreseeable future.",
    "Sentence_122": "These provisions can  encourage cooperation by landowners and other affected parties in  implementing conservation measures.",
    "Sentence_123": "This allows for use of the land  while at the same time ensuring the preservation of suitable habitat  and minimizing impact on the species.     ",
    "Sentence_124": "Under the Act, ``take'' means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot,  wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any  such conduct.",
    "Sentence_125": "Some of these provisions have been further defined in  regulation at 50 CFR 17.3.",
    "Sentence_126": "Take can result knowingly or otherwise, by  direct and indirect impacts, intentionally or incidentally.",
    "Sentence_127": "Regulating  intentional and incidental take under this 4(d) rule will help preserve  the species' remaining populations; enable beneficial management  actions to occur; and decrease synergistic, negative effects from other  stressors.     ",
    "Sentence_128": "We may issue permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities,  including those described above, involving threatened wildlife under  certain circumstances.",
    "Sentence_129": "Regulations governing permits are codified at 50  CFR 17.32.",
    "Sentence_130": "With regard to threatened wildlife, a permit may be issued  for the following purposes: For scientific purposes, to enhance  propagation or survival, for economic hardship, for zoological  exhibition, for educational purposes, for incidental taking, or for  special purposes consistent with the purposes of the Act.",
    "Sentence_131": "There are  also certain statutory exemptions from the prohibitions, which are  found in sections 9 and 10 of the Act.     ",
    "Sentence_132": "The Service recognizes the special and unique relationship with our  State natural resource agency partners in contributing to conservation  of listed species.",
    "Sentence_133": "State agencies often possess scientific data and  valuable expertise on the status and distribution of endangered,  threatened, and candidate species of wildlife and plants.",
    "Sentence_134": "State  agencies, because of their authorities and their close working  relationships with local governments and landowners, are in a unique  position to assist the Services in implementing all aspects of the Act.  ",
    "Sentence_135": "In this regard, section 6 of the Act provides that the Services shall  cooperate to the maximum extent practicable with the States in carrying  out programs authorized by the Act.",
    "Sentence_136": "Therefore, any qualified employee  or agent of a State conservation agency that is a party to a  cooperative agreement with the Service in accordance with section 6(c)  of the Act, who is designated by his or her agency for such purposes,  would be able to conduct activities designed to conserve trispot darter  that may result in otherwise prohibited take without additional  authorization.     ",
    "Sentence_137": "Nothing in this 4(d) rule changes in any way the recovery planning  provisions of section 4(f) of the Act, the consultation requirements  under section 7 of the Act, or the ability of the Service to enter into  partnerships for the management and protection of the trispot darter.
