    "Sentence_101": "The  January 20, 2021, memorandum from the Assistant to the President and  Chief of Staff, entitled ``Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,''  instructed federal agencies to consider delaying the effective date of  rules published in the Federal Register, but which have not yet taken  effect, for a period of 60 days so that the new Administration may  review recently published rules for ``any questions of fact, law, and  policy the rule may raise.''",
    "Sentence_102": "The memorandum notes certain exceptions  that do not apply here.",
    "Sentence_103": "On January 20, 2021, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) also published OMB Memorandum M-21-14, Implementation  of Memorandum Concerning Regulatory Freeze Pending Review, which  provides guidance regarding the Regulatory Freeze Memorandum.",

    "Sentence_110": "HHS needs to extend the effective date of the  underlying rule by 60 days to determine whether its promulgation raises  any legal issues, including but not limited to (1) whether the Advisory  Commission on Childhood Vaccines was properly notified of the proposed  rule pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 300aa-14(c), and (2) whether the public was  properly notified of the entire revised regulation, 42 CFR 100.3(b)-(e)  (including the qualifications and aids to interpretation and the  coverage provisions), given that both the proposed and final rules  published in the Federal Register included only the revised Vaccine  Injury Table itself, but not the entire revised regulation.",
    "Sentence_111": "HHS  believes that the proposed delay is reasonable, would allow HHS time to  receive public comments, and would not be disruptive since the  underlying rule has not yet taken effect and the agency has not yet  implemented the rule.     ",
    "Sentence_112": "HHS seeks comment on the proposed delay, including the proposed  delay's impact on any legal, factual, or policy issues raised by the  underlying rule and whether further review of those issues warrants  such a delay.",
