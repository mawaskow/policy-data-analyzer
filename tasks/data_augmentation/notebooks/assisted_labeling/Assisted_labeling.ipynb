    "In this notebook there is a basic implementation of sBERT for searching a database of sentences with queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to increase the amount of labeled data that we have in order to later fine tune a model to be used for sentence classification. First of all we have to find a pool of queries that represent the six labels of the six policy instruments. With these queries we can pull a set of sentences that can be automaticaly labeled with the same label of the query. In this way we can increase the diversity of labeled sentences in each label category. This approach will be complemented with a manual curation step to produce a high quality training data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy instruments that we want to find and that correspond to the different labels are:\n",
    "* Direct payment (PES)\n",
    "* Tax deduction\n",
    "* Credit/guarantee\n",
    "* Technical assistance\n",
    "* Supplies\n",
    "* Fines\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended for the following purposes:\n",
    "* Loading of a database of sentences\n",
    "* Create sentence embeddings for further processing\n",
    "* Define the queries corresponding to the labels\n",
    "* Compute the cosine similarity score between the embeddings of the sentences and those of the queries"
